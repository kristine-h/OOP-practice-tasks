Task 1. 
Create a class named Student. The Student contains two private char arrays - name[20], surname[40]. The class contains two public member functions
    1. set() - this function is used to input the name and surname of a student.
    2. get() - this function is used to print the name and surname of a student.
In the main() function create an array[5] of Student objects and call the functions into those objects. 

Task 2. 
Write a program that would print the information (name, year of joining, salary, address) of three employees by creating a class named ‘Employee’. The output should be as follows:
Name        Year of joining        Address
Robert        2017                 64C - Wall street
Sam           2020                 68D - Wall street
John          2018                 26B - Wall street

Task 3. 
Write a class Circle that computes the area and circumference given a radius that is supplied to the class as a parameter at the time of instantiation. Pi should be contained in a constant private member that cannot be accessed from outside the circle. 

Task 4. 
Write a program to print the area and perimeter of a triangle having sides of 3, 4 and 5 units by creating a class named “Triangle” with a function to print the area and perimeter. 

Task 5. 
Print the sum, difference and product of two complex numbers by creating a class named ‘Complex’ with separate functions for each operation whose real and imaginary parts are entered by the user.

Task 6. 
Write a program for the Fibonacci series. The class Fibonacci must contain three private variables type of int - x, y and z. x and y must be by default 0 and 1, z will be x + y. The class must contain a public member function generator with one parameter of type int - number. The generator function must print the number of terms you need in the series. 

Task 7. 
Write a program that defines a simple Vertex class(a point on the x-y plane) having two integer components for the x and y values. Your program should generate 5 random vertices each having integer values in the range of [-100,100], and write them to the terminal. To generate a random number, use the rand() function.
